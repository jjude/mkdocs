The Ten Commandments had it all: - Worship only the True God, not your stuff or your status or yourself. - Take a day off every week -- it's a healthy lifestyle. - Don't steal other people's stuff -- private property matters. - Don't murder -- sanctity of human life. - Don't run around on your spouse -- stable families are where kids are best trained for life. The broader Mosaic Law included provision for the poor and widows (gleaning the landowners' leftovers), that still required some effort by the recipients. It also built a justice system, including restitution to the victims of property crimes, plus fines. This framework, coupled with expansive technology, is what produced the fantastic wealth of our society. And the left is intent on making us forget all about it, by denigrating faith in God and concentrating power in the hands of the elite. A lot like Maoist China.","title":"Capitalism and Bible"},{"location":"Certain%20To%20Win/","text":"","title":"Certain To Win"},{"location":"Concepts/","text":"Flywheels Homeschooling","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"Data%20Analytics%20in%20Supply%20Chain%20Management/","text":"Advantages of AI, Data Analytics, BlockChain and Big Data applications in various areas of Supply Chain Management \u00b6 Talks for Indian Institute of Materials Management, Chandigarh Branch References \u00b6 https://appinventiv.com/blog/ai-in-supply-chain-analytics/ https://www.intuz.com/blog/ai-and-blockchain-in-supply-chain-management https://erpsolutions.oodles.io/blog/big-data-in-supply-chain/ https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69320","title":"Data Analytics in Supply Chain Management"},{"location":"Data%20Analytics%20in%20Supply%20Chain%20Management/#advantages-of-ai-data-analytics-blockchain-and-big-data-applications-in-various-areas-of-supply-chain-management","text":"Talks for Indian Institute of Materials Management, Chandigarh Branch","title":"Advantages of AI, Data Analytics, BlockChain and Big Data applications in various areas of Supply Chain Management"},{"location":"Data%20Analytics%20in%20Supply%20Chain%20Management/#references","text":"https://appinventiv.com/blog/ai-in-supply-chain-analytics/ https://www.intuz.com/blog/ai-and-blockchain-in-supply-chain-management https://erpsolutions.oodles.io/blog/big-data-in-supply-chain/ https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/69320","title":"References"},{"location":"Developing%20a%20Fediverse%20App/","tags":["tech","fediverse"],"text":"Developing an app for Fediverse requires you to know lot of protocols (rules; you need to follow them for communications; need not implement all of them) and standards (guidelines).

Yes An almost-assassinated leader gets so much credibility, so he can stay in power and gets to stick around to enjoy it. Silvia Broome is an interpreter at the UN. One night, she hears two men whisper, \"The teacher will never leave his room alive.\" She is convinced that the plot involves the visiting Matobo president, Edmond Zuwanie, an alleged war criminal. She informs UN security, and US secret service agents get involved. The plot twists and turns with a cast of suspects including Silvia, since she lost her family and once participated in an armed rebellion in Matobo. What I admired about the movie is how it handles the tension between peaceful and violent means of handling large-scale crimes like genocide. Having read such incidents all over the world, I can sympathize with Silvia Broome's plight. There is no Nicole Kidman, just Silvia Broome, who walks tightly between wanting vengeance and serving justice. In the end, justice is served through non-violence at the UN. Maybe there is hope for victims of authoritarian rules. Quotes I liked \u00b6 Silvia Broome: Vengeance is a lazy form of grief. Tobin Keller: You think that not getting caught in a lie is the same thing as telling the truth. Zuwanie: THE GUNFIRE AROUND us makes it hard to hear. But the human voice is different from other sounds. It can be heard over noises that bury everything else. Even when it's not shouting. Even when it's just a whisper. Even the lowest whisper can be heard - -over armies... when it's telling the truth.","title":"Interpreter"},{"location":"Interpreter/#quotes-i-liked","text":"Silvia Broome: Vengeance is a lazy form of grief.

Authorization Code Grant: A code is issued and used to obtain the access_token . This code is released to a front-end application (on the browser) after the user logs in. The access_token instead, is issued Server side, authenticating the client with its password and the obtained code . Implicit Grant: after the user logs in, the access_token is issued immediately. Client Credential Grant: the \u2019 access_token is issued on the server, authenticating only the client, not the user.

If disciples or others wanted to make up the resurrection story, they would have cooked up so Jesus appears to someone powerful (may be sympathetic to their cause), like Joseph of Arimathea. Today Christianity is a powerful force. But when it started it had less chance of survival. Disciples were afraid even to come out of their room. Both Roman system and Jewish religious hierarchy wanted them suppressed and terminated. These were the powerful politicial and religious systems in which they lived. They could have survived as a cult within Jewish religion, not as a unit which claimed resurrection of their leader. These disciples were not working towards liberation of their land. They were preaching entirely different theology and philosophy. Their communion was thought of as canablism since these disciples said they are eating the flesh and drinking thr blood of Jesus. Paul a well respected Pharisee risks his life for resurrection. He undergoes jail time, beatings, and other torture to preach this resurrected Jesus, and finally his life. He would not have lost everything, if he didn't believe in it that much. Same with almost all of the disciples. They all lost their lives in far away lands.

Like Jeremiah he called the people to repentance and foretold the eventual rebuilding of Jerusalem. Ezekiel\u2019s call begins with a vision of God. In the vision he sees four strange creatures (Ezekiel 1:10). Each one is a witness to part of the character of God. The first has the face of a human being, the second a lion, representing strength and courage, the third an ox, representing fertility, and the fourth an eagle, representing speed. Together they point to the awesome majesty and greatness of God (v.10).

He has enough blessing to give to everyone Jesus answers the blind, let it be done according to your faith. Same goes for us too. It will be done to us as per our faith. When Jesus heals the blind, people rejoice. But Pharisees say this is by the prince of demons. They were not able to accept Jesus as who he was. So they demonize him. Same happens today too.

As in [[Luke-06#v38]], there is overflowing of blessing. David's cup runs over. David doesn't stop with enjoying the material blessings. He is again making a choice. He says, he will dwell in God's house forever. Now it is both a choice and a declaration of faith. He knows God will not let him down, so he will dwell there. As it happened in [[Luke-05#v11]] with apostles, when we receive material blessings, our response should be a realization of our unworthiness and thus following Jesus; V2 - he leads you besides quiet waters. When you lie down on green pastures and drink from quiet waters there is a possibility you look at others whose life is full of drama and think am I missing something? You don\u2019t.

It is a wonderful contrast to the previous book of Judges. While the context of the two books is identical (Ruth is set \u2018in the days when the judges ruled\u2019, 1:1), the content of the two books is very different. While Judges recounts a catalogue of evil and upheaval because \u2018everyone did as they saw fit\u2019 (Judges 21:25), the book of Ruth is a wonderful story of loyalty, faithfulness and kindness \u2013 all the more impressive for taking place in this period of strife. Furthermore, while Judges looks at the big picture of the nation of Israel during this period, the book of Ruth is focused on a specific family. It is a reminder to us that the God of the universe and of history is also the God of all the little details in your life. He is not just almighty and powerful, but he is also your Father who is intimately concerned with you. Your life and all the details matter to God. Your life counts. The book of Ruth reminds us of God\u2019s care, provision and faithfulness in the little pieces of our life. Naomi was more concerned for Ruth than for herself. Naomi wanted Ruth to return home so that she might have a better chance of remarrying and Naomi is prepared to lose Ruth for the sake of Ruth\u2019s happiness (Ruth 1:8\u201313). Ruth\u2019s love for Naomi was equally unselfish and self-giving. She is quite prepared not to get married again. She shows extraordinary loyalty to her mother-in-law. She says, \u2018Don\u2019t force me to leave you; don\u2019t make me go home. Where you go, I go; and where you live, I\u2019ll live. Your people are my people, your God is my god; where you die, I\u2019ll die, and that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be buried, so help me God \u2013 not even death itself is going to come between us!\u2019 (vv.16\u201317, MSG). Boaz was also a God-fearing person. He had heard of Ruth\u2019s reputation. She was not only loyal and faithful \u2013 she was extremely hard working (2:7). Someone must have testified about her. Boaz says, \u2018I\u2019ve heard all about you \u2013 heard about the way you treated your mother-in-law after the death of her husband, and how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth and have come to live among a bunch of total strangers\u2019 (v.11, MSG). Furthermore, Ruth had obviously testified about her own faith in God, for Boaz knows that she is committed to \u2018God, to whom you\u2019ve come seeking protection under his wings\u2019 (v.12, MSG). Boaz then shows extraordinary kindness to Ruth. Ruth says to her mother-in-law, \u2018The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz\u2026 He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead\u2019 (vv.19\u201320). There are no divine visitation or angelic scene. But poverty of a family was dealt with by the human adherence to the law of God. Kindness and commitment wins the day. This book answers the question, where is God when people are dying in poverty. God has set rules, set role models. We are to follow and redeem the people and the land.","title":"Notes on Ruth"},{"location":"bible-notes/Timothy/","text":"Bible Notes Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek.

Then the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhy are you angry? Why is your face downcast? If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door ; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.\u201d Now Cain said to his brother Abel, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the field.\u201d While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.\u201d - Genesis\u202c 4:3-8\u202c You could be killed for doing right things \u00b6 Even though there was no command to offer the first fruits, Abel through eyes of faith, offers the lord fat portions of his flock. From this we can deduce he is a faithful man. He is probably a diligent man in everything he does. He goes along with his brother without hesitation, so probably he is loving too. He didn\u2019t let his success goes to his head. He stays humble. Despite all his qualities he is killed. Probably because of his good qualities he is killed. Even today many such Abels are killed throughout the world. Expecting our lives to be without problems because we are good is just a naive expectation. Where is god when bad things happen to good people is a question that rings from the beginning of the world. Your faith is felt long after you are gone \u00b6 By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks. - Hebrews\u202c 11\u202c:4\u202c (WEBUS\u202c\u202c) If you don't do what is right, sin is crouching at your door \u00b6 \u201cdoing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;\u201d \u202d\u202dPhilippians\u202c \u202d2\u202c:\u202d3\u202c \u202dWEBUS\u202c\u202c https://bible.com/bible/206/php.2.3.WEBUS No jealousy","title":"Murder of Abel"},{"location":"deaths-in-Bible/Murder%20Of%20Abel/#you-could-be-killed-for-doing-right-things","text":"Even though there was no command to offer the first fruits, Abel through eyes of faith, offers the lord fat portions of his flock.
