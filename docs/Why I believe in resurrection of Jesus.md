- As per the gospels account, after resurrection, Jesus appears to a woman (Mary). Even now, women don't have higher standing in lot of partiarchial societies. If disciples or others wanted to make up the resurrection story, they would have cooked up so Jesus appears to someone powerful (may be sympathetic to their cause), like Joseph of Arimathea.
- Today Christianity is a powerful force. But when it started it had less chance of survival. Disciples were afraid even to come out of their room. Both Roman system and Jewish religious hierarchy wanted them suppressed and terminated. These were the powerful politicial and religious systems in which they lived. They could have survived as a cult within Jewish religion, not as a unit which claimed resurrection of their leader. 
- These disciples were not working towards liberation of their land. They were preaching entirely different theology and philosophy. Their communion was thought of as canablism since these disciples said they are eating the flesh and drinking thr blood of Jesus.
- Paul a well respected Pharisee risks his life for resurrection. He undergoes jail time, beatings, and other torture to preach this resurrected Jesus, and finally his life. He would not have lost everything, if he didn't believe in it that much. 
- Same with almost all of the disciples. They all lost their lives in far away lands. I can't believe 11 people will wander through the unknown world and risk disease and death to spread a lie in a hostile world (both weather and political)
