Rainmaking is the hardest part of running a biz. We all struggle in different stages. From my exp:

- Nailing your ICP is the hardest part. If this is nailed well, everything falls in place. If not, nothing else will work
- What you'll offer / not offer. As a small agency hungry for growth, it is a constant temptation to do more. Fight it
- Better to be vertically integrated than horizontal. Horizontal is easy as a techie but vertical builds trust.
