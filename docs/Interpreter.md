Will I see it again? Yes

> An almost-assassinated leader gets so much credibility, so he can stay in power and gets to stick around to enjoy it.

Silvia Broome is an interpreter at the UN. One night, she hears two men whisper, "The teacher will never leave his room alive." She is convinced that the plot involves the visiting Matobo president, Edmond Zuwanie, an alleged war criminal. She informs UN security, and US secret service agents get involved.

The plot twists and turns with a cast of suspects including Silvia, since she lost her family and once participated in an armed rebellion in Matobo.

What I admired about the movie is how it handles the tension between peaceful and violent means of handling large-scale crimes like genocide. Having read such incidents all over the world, I can sympathize with Silvia Broome's plight. There is no Nicole Kidman, just Silvia Broome, who walks tightly between wanting vengeance and serving justice.

In the end, justice is served through non-violence at the UN. Maybe there is hope for victims of authoritarian rules.

## Quotes I liked
- Silvia Broome: Vengeance is a lazy form of grief.
- Tobin Keller: You think that not getting caught in a lie is the same thing as telling the truth.
- Zuwanie: THE GUNFIRE AROUND us makes it hard to hear. But the human voice is different from other sounds. It can be heard over noises that bury everything else. Even when it's not shouting. Even when it's just a whisper. Even the lowest whisper can be heard - -over armies... when it's telling the truth.
