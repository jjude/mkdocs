The basis for the success of western capitalism: the Judeo-Christian combination of "love God" (i.e., accountability to the Higher Power), and "love your neighbor as yourself" (i.e., accountability for how we treat others). 

The Ten Commandments had it all: 
- Worship only the True God, not your stuff or your status or yourself. 
- Take a day off every week -- it's a healthy lifestyle. 
- Don't steal other people's stuff -- private property matters. 
- Don't murder -- sanctity of human life. 
- Don't run around on your spouse -- stable families are where kids are best trained for life. 

The broader Mosaic Law included provision for the poor and widows (gleaning the landowners' leftovers), that still required some effort by the recipients. It also built a justice system, including restitution to the victims of property crimes, plus fines. 

This framework, coupled with expansive technology, is what produced the fantastic wealth of our society. And the left is intent on making us forget all about it, by denigrating faith in God and concentrating power in the hands of the elite. A lot like Maoist China.
