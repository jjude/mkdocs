# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

I'm Joseph Jude, a CTO, coach, and podcast host. Good to see you here. I have been writing and maintaining a digital presence since [August, 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20030802053325/http://jjude.com/).

## What You'll Find Here
I use [consume, produce, engage](https://jjude.com/sdl) to learn new concepts. I organise all my learning and activities under WINS - **W**ealth, **I**nsights, **N**eworking, and **S**elf. Short 
- Wealth
	- What it means
	- How to acquire
	- How to compound
	- How to protect
	- You can find more under [[wealth]]
- Insights
	- Consume the best resources
	- Produce an article / video to solidify your understanding
	- Engage to get different perspectives of the topic
	- You can find more under [[insights]]
- Networking
	- Your network determines your networth
	- Increase your visibility
	- Build your credibility
	- Improve your profitability (let your network work for you)
	- You can find more under [[network]]
- Self
	- You can find more under [[self]]

I track my progress on these four under [[action]]

Last piece in the puzzle of learning is "engage." Here is how you can play a role in mutually improving each other.
