title: "Deaths In The Bible"

I was attending the memorial service of my uncle. He got a job for my mother and gave us a headstart on the path to prosperity. Not only he put us on that journey, he visited us every year with his family and stayed in our small 1 bed room house and ate rice porridge that we had without any qualms. 

As I stood there pondering his life and all that he meant for me, I had an idea. What if we walked to the funerals of those mentioned in the Bible? What would I consider? What would I ponder as how they lived their life, what are the lessons for me?

There was also another nudge for this. I had started to consider my own death seriously. Moses prays, “Lord, help us to count our days so we would gain a heart of wisdom”. Steven Covey in his popular book encourages to write your obituary to discover the values you want to exhibit in this life. Even Steve jobs says knowing that he is going to die helped him make important decisions well. 

I started meditating on the deaths mentioned in the Bible. Like any other topic, as I started meditating, it only went deeper and deeper and amazing. I had a mixed feeling of somber and euphoria. I hope I have expressed those two emotions well in these pages.

These are only of people whose deaths are mentioned in the Bible. So Paul and Peter don’t find a mention here, not because they didn’t live a life of worth. 

Also even though Jesus’ death is mentioned in the Bible I am not including it here because I don’t think two pages are sufficient enough to capture the lessons.

Don’t take life casually. Find your calling, and let that calling propel you forward every day.
