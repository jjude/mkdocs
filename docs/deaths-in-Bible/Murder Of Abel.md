The Bible starts with death of an innocent boy. Abel is the son of the first human. He did everything right. He worked hard, he got rewarded for his work, and he brings the finest of his flock as an offering to the Lord, even though there was no command to do so. Through faith he recognised the one who gave the land, the ability to work, and blessed him with such a reward. 

But he lays dead. Not a natural death but a violent, gruesome one. From Abel to Naboth to Stephan, the Bible is filled with accounts of violent deaths of the innocent. What is Bible teaching us through these murders?

Why? Why did the lord allow it?

“In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord. And Abel also brought an offering—**fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock**. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. Then the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But **if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door**; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.” Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.” While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.” - Genesis‬ 4:3-8‬


## You could be killed for doing right things

Even though there was no command to offer the first fruits, Abel through eyes of faith, offers the lord fat portions of his flock. From this we can deduce he is a faithful man. He is probably a diligent man in everything he does. 

He goes along with his brother without hesitation, so probably he is loving too. He didn’t let his success goes to his head. He stays humble.

Despite all his qualities he is killed. Probably because of his good qualities he is killed. Even today many such Abels are killed throughout the world. Expecting our lives to be without problems because we are good is just a naive expectation. 

Where is god when bad things happen to good people is a question that rings from the beginning of the world. 

## Your faith is felt long after you are gone


By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks. - Hebrews‬ 11‬:4‬ (WEBUS‬‬)

## If you don't do what is right, sin is crouching at your door



“doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;”
‭‭Philippians‬ ‭2‬:‭3‬ ‭WEBUS‬‬
