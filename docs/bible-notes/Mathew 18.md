- We all chase after big numbers. We want thousands of people in our churches; wants millions of followers. But Jesus worries about one. One lost soul. Because he is a personal God. The one who created the world, can patiently wait for one Samaritan women and pay attention to her. Are we going after lost souls or are we still chasing big numbers?
- Even when we are praying, we don't pay attention to the one who is with us. Our mind is drifting, is divided.
- A king forgives ten thousand bags of gold of debt of a servant. But the same servant doesn't extend the same grace to one who owes few silver coins. Do we hold grudge for years against a family member who yelled at us? #forgiveness
- As Joyce Meyer says, even after forgiving you might still feel anger towards the other person. That is ok. Ask God to heal your emotions.
