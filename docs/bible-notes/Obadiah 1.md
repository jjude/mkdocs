## Key Verses
- You should not gloat over your brother in the day of his misfortune, nor rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction, nor boast so much in the day of their trouble. You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster, nor gloat over them in their calamity in the day of their disaster, nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster. - Obadiah‬ 1:12-13‬
- The day of the Lord is near for all nations. As you have done, it will be done to you; your deeds will return upon your own head. - Obadiah‬ 1:15‬

- Even when our enemies face destruction we are to pray for their salvation, not float over their misfortune
