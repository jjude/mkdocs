## John the Baptist was beheaded
- those on power are really powerless people when they become people pleasers
- Jesus goes to a solitary place probably to mourn and pray for the death of his cousin and his fellow missionary
- John might have believed Jesus would deliver him from the prison

## Jesus feeds the 5000
- only miracle recorded in all the four gospels
- Despite his deep felt sadness, Jesus takes care of people who comes in search of him
- After taking care of the people he goes alone to the mountain to pray

## Jesus walks on water
- In a short span of text Jesus is a miracle worker, teacher, and God
- Jesus doesn't fail to teach the disciples at any chance. Here he teaches Peter - why little faith. You were different from others. You had faith,  but you only had little
- The monotheistic Jews worship Jesus, a man. Did they finally realize his divinity?
