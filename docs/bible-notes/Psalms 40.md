title: "Notes on Psalms 40"
---
- [[Psalms]]
- V3: He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.
	- See
		- What does it mean to see a song? Is it his lifestyle? Is it praising God in a manner that is visible to all?
		- It is also about sharing your testimony among the assembly of your people - [[Ps-22#v22]]
	- Fear
		- In the Bible fear mean respect in many places; like fear of the Lord; your song should bring fear (respect) of the Lord; not disrespect
		- 
	- Trust
		- Your song, praise should nudge people to trust in the Lord
