- [[Acts]]
- Cornelius was a rich man. But he was not attached to his money. He gave generously. It is not that rich can not enter heaven, it is how you are attached to it.
- The angle spoke directly to Cornelius- send for Peter. But to Peter, the vision was in metaphor, not a direct command like, go and preach to Cornelius and other gentiles in Joppa. Why?
- Cornelius invited his friends. He has already become an evangelist.
