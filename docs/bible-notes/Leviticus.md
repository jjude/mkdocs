title: "Notes on Leviticus"
---
- [[Bible Notes]]
- Holy is not some actions you do. It is the whole life - what you eat, whom you have sex with, what you sacrifice etc.
- It is setting apart for God
- John - Jesus - word became flesh & tabernacled with us
- John was willing to be beheaded for Leviticus 18 - you will take your brother‘s wife
- When you come to an exam you need to bring
	- Body
	- Mind (intention)
	- Supporting instruments
	- Go through the ritual (of writing)
	- But also should have been prepared
- Bible talks about personal God & personal sin
- Lev 1 - 16 : tent of Yahweh
- Lev 17 - : tents of people
- Personal holiness & family, church holiness matters to the Lord
- Jesus heals the leper (Leviticus says you can’t touch lepers) but tells him to obey what is commanded (go and show yourself to the priest). Jesus knows what to break and not to break.
