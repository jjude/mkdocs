## Temptation of Jesus
- The spirit leads Jesus into wilderness for testing. But it is the devil which tempted Jesus. God allows, even leads. But it is the devil that tempts. Not God.
- There are three tests that happen:
	- physical needs
	- intelligence needs
	- status needs
- Jesus overcomes each with a verse. Satan too knows Bible. Just that he doesn't believe in it. You could memorize something, say it everyday without really believing in its power. When you realise the power, like Jesus, you can be a winner too.
- **Physical Needs**
- **Intelligence Needs**
	- common sense
	- covid treatment
- **Status Needs**

## Calling the first disciples
