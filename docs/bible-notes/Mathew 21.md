- Say to Daughter Zion, ‘See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’  - Matthew‬ 21:5‬ (NIV‬‬)
	- Jesus knew he was a king. He was confident in his own skin. He didn’t seek validity of people. He didn’t need external validation of his position. His position was God given, not of human making. This confidence translates into humbleness. Riding a donkey doesn’t reduce his kingship. He was anchored to Father.
	- When I was young (during the time I was in Belgium), I always wore suits. I wanted to hide my insecurities. I wanted to appear more than what I was. Once I became confident, my desire in suits went away. If someone didn’t respect me because I wasn’t wearing a suit didn’t bother me. I had enough too. At around the same time, I joined the government. Wherever I went I represented the government department.
- [[Matt-21#v21]] - “Jesus answered them, “Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith and don’t doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done.”
	- I believe in this verse. But my difficulty is I don’t know what’s best for me. And what’s God’s will (meaning what God wants to accomplish through me). Most often the faith seems to be to want something for myself within a time frame. Even if the prayer point is valid I always get the timing wrong. 
	- But when I came to Panchkula I saw that faith in me work. I had lost the revenue stream. But I was sure God sent me here. I gave myself time until December to get a job, and I got one by November. 
	- Right now (2022-10-28) my prayers are around getting the gifts of the Holy Spirit, seeing growth in the church, constructing of church for pastor. Raja, and seeing growth of Radha & Stephan.
