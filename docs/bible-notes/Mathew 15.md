- Tradition of the elders # written law; today too we might force people into obedience of tradition rather than the Biblical principles; (ex love marriages are not accepted in Indian Christian circles; ). We shouldn't turn into Pharisees by adding to Biblical principles that Jesus and his disciples preached and practiced
- External rituals don't purify us or make us unholy; at best, they are aids and guides
	- ref. [[1 Corinthians 14]] & [[1 Timothy 2]] about women teaching in church; they are about external practices.
- Because of the opposition, Jesus leaves to gentiles area; be careful you are not quenching the Holy Spirit; or driving away your anointing by your adherence to traditions rather than to Biblical principles
- The Canaanite woman begged so much that it was annoying and irritating to the disciples (but not to Jesus). She didn't stop until Jesus engaged with her. And even when she was insulted, she didn't give up. The desire, the pain was so deep the insult didn't amount much. She knew the deliverance is here and now. And she gets it.
- They praised the "God of Israel",  (v31) which indicates these miracles were performed to non-Jewish
- Here too Jesus feeds large gathering (like the previous chapter). But this is to the gentiles. Even though Jesus focused on Jews, even during his time, he went to the gentiles, preached, and performed miracles.
