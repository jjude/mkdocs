title: "Notes on Ezekiel"

- [[Bible Notes]]
- Ezekiel was called by God (in 593 BC) at the age of 30 (v.1). He was a priest (v.3). He was a Jewish exile in Babylonia (whereas Jeremiah was in Jerusalem). He was taken captive with the young king Jehoiachin in 597 BC (2 Kings 24:8–17). Like Jeremiah he called the people to repentance and foretold the eventual rebuilding of Jerusalem. 
- Ezekiel’s call begins with a vision of God. In the vision he sees four strange creatures (Ezekiel 1:10). Each one is a witness to part of the character of God.
- The first has the face of a human being, the second a lion, representing strength and courage, the third an ox, representing fertility, and the fourth an eagle, representing speed. Together they point to the awesome majesty and greatness of God (v.10).
- Ezekiel is asked to enact visual aids to show the seriousness of sin and the warning of the impending judgment that will happen if the people do not repent
- It has probably always been the case that people are more likely to remember what they see than what they hear.
