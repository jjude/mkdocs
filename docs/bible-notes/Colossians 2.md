- [[Colossians]]
- https://colossians.bible/colossians-2/
- Christ is God’s mystery. In him lie all the untapped wisdom and knowledge.
- Rules and regulations sound impressive. They give an illusion of humility and piety. They can’t free you from fleshly desires.
- “I want you woven into a tapestry of love, in touch with everything there is to know of God. Then you will have minds confident and at rest, focused on Christ, God’s great mystery. All the richest treasures of wisdom and knowledge are embedded in that mystery and nowhere else. And we’ve been shown the mystery! I’m telling you this because I don’t want anyone leading you off on some wild-goose chase, after other so-called mysteries, or “the Secret.”” - Colossians‬ 2:2-4‬ MSG‬‬
