- John is languishing in prison. If Jesus is Messiah why John is not freed? May be he has doubts.
- The violent always raids the kingdom of God. Why?
- The world is full of extremists on both sides of the spectrum accusing you all the time. You are not dancing with us; you are not mourning with us. They want to set their agenda for us. If we don't fit their mold, we are labeled, discriminated, and raided. Don't fit labels.
- We want to control everybody. If they go faster they are madmen. If they go slower than us, they are dumb. We are the only people who are right.
