title: "Notes on Acts 12"
---

- [[Acts]]
- Acts 12 starts with Herod on the throne and Peter is in jail. At the end, Herod is dead, Peter is out, and church is thriving. When church prays together, miracles happen. 
- The angel has to kick in the side to wake up Peter. He slept so well even amidst threat to his life. 
- God will not do what you can do. Angel broke the chains, opened the door, blinded the soldiers, but Peter has to wake up and walk out. Angel could have carried him and left him in the house. That didn’t happen.
- As [[Ps-119#v105]] says, how word is only a lamp. It will only show the next step. Will not reveal the entire plan. The angel told Peter to get up. The angel didn’t reveal he is going to deliver Peter. Peter could have asked, why should I get up when I am in chains. What good would it do. No. He gets up and walks out because he obeyed the smallest command God sent. 
- The guards were executed. What is the mistake they did? Is it fair to them and their family? Bible is silent about it. 
- May be these guards will ask Peter, if you would have shared the gospel with us like Paul & Silas, we would have believed and saved.
- In [[Acts-05#v19]], an angel of the Lord delivers when the apostles were put in jail.  It when James was beheaded, there was no rescue. But then Peter was rescued. Why one and not the other? I don’t know. This is why we can’t generalise Biblical promises & commands (other than the Ten Commandments).
