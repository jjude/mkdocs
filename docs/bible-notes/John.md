- [[Bible Notes]]
- John along with all the apostles heard that Jesus came to save the sinners. They heard from Jesus, the word, the God himself. Yet they didn’t understand and hence didn’t believe. It took the death and resurrection for the disciples to understand. It is possible we as Christians might hear a promise or a command and yet we may not grasp it for long. Our lives change only when we grasp that promise.
