- [[1 Kings]] 
- [[Phil-04#v19]]
- ## God meeting our needs
	- I always wonder if I would have enough for the old age. Appa & Amma have enough for the retirement. Joy has many houses. But I don’t have those. 
	- on [[2022-11-02]] I read [[Overcome the fear of lack]] and on the same day meditated on this chapter. 
	- here God directs Elijah to a brook first. There a crow feeds him. A person needs food, water, and shelter. God provides. As in [[Ps-147#v14]] he gets meat & bread twice daily.
	- What Elijah prophesied comes to affect him - the brook dries because there is no rain. We might suffer because of the sinful nature of the nation. Yet God leads him to another place. 
	- He directs him to a widow who is going to suicide. God doesn’t tell anything abt the dire situation of the widow to Elijah. God feeds Elijah and blesses the widow too. Double miracle.
- [[Ps-119#v105]] - God’s word is a lamp not sunlight. He shows to Elijah only the brook first. Then only abt the widow. He doesn’t tell Elijah that the widow is going to die. It is progressively revealed to him, as the interplay of human action and God’s wisdom. We should be willing to take the steps that God shows us. 
- There is a dark comedy in how Elijah responds to the widow. He doesn’t comfort her. He says go do what you have planned. God changes your situation by your work not by magic.
- [[Gen-12#v10]] - even when God leads you to a place there could be a drought. Both Abraham and Elijah didn’t doubt God’s guidance. They go ahead with what God reveals next. God’s plan is revealed progressively. 
- God asks Elijah to hide. Sometimes it is wise to hide. When you are secure in your calling, you don’t mind hiding. There is no false confidence here.
