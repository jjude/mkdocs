- [[Mathew]] / [[Mathew 24]] / [[Mathew 26]]
- The foolish virgins were not prepared with oil. The wise ones refuse to share their oil with them. If the wise ones would have shared their oil they would have lost out on the wedding banquet. Later in Acts we read that the disciples sold everything and shared everything among them that there was no one in need. What is the lesson here? How are we supposed to share? With whom are we to share?
- Is the Bible encouraging polygamy here?
- Later in v40, it says when you did for one of the least you did it for me. So how am I supposed to share my wealth? What does it say about philanthropy?
- [[Prov-11#v15]] - why lose your inheritance for your help
