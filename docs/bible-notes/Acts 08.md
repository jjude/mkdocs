title: "Notes on Acts 08"
---

- [[Acts]]
- https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8&version=WEB
- Even the dispersed disciples were not afraid even though they were persecuted for their faith
- Philip is doing miracles. Why even helpers should be anointed
- Apostles sent Peter and John. P & J subjected themselves to the church, even though they were seniors
- In [[Acts 06]], apostles said they will focus on prayer and preaching. It is not that they avoid facing problems. They know what they have to work on and what they have to delegate
- You can't trade Holy Spirit. He is a gift.
- angel of the Lord commands Philip to go to the road from Jerusalem to Gaza. Nothing else. He is not told why. He is not told he is going to play the pivotal role in spreading the gospel in Ethiopia. He obeys and successive events happen. Are you obeying the initial commands of the Lord?
- Philip was taken by the Spirit as soon as the job was done. He didn't tarry there to get glory or praise or reward from the treasurer of the queen. If you are an obedient servant of God thats what will happen.
