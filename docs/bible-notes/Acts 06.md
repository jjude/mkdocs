- [[Acts]]

- It is ok for divisions to appear in the churches. It is normal. But how you handle matters. Apostles handled in an effective manner in a way it will solve the problem and also pleasing to everyone because they involved the church members and not decide unilaterally.
- These men were not appointed by the apostles, but the church selected them. Even then apostles delegated the responsibilities.
- They have to select men filled with the Holy Spirit, because you don't know who will have be required to testify.
