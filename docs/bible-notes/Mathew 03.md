## Ministry of John the Baptist
- The Bible is always about fruits manifesting the inner beliefs. Without actions, beliefs are farce.
- John shows a form of courage that Jesus will display later in the temple. John’s is not arrogance but courage. He isn’t saying “I am the one.” No. He clearly says, “I am unworthy to the one who comes in the name of the Lord.”
- As like Jesus, knowing his place gives him enormous confidence. He knows his days are in the hands of the Lord. So he is fearless towards soldiers and Bible scholars.
- Like Jesus, John is both humble and confident.
## Baptism of Jesus
- Only those who know themselves deeply can humble themselves. Jesus was so confident of his position in the grand scheme of things that he readily submitted to John for baptism.
- Time and again we see Jesus both confident and humble. He doesn’t mind calling priests, pharisees or Sadducee as vipers; but at the same time he doesn’t mind sitting among the masses and teaching them for hours. In every way he is a lion and lamb.
- It is a challenging job to imitate Christ, because we are predisposed to one or the other and we find it difficult to lean over to the other side.
- But only when we submit, heavens will open and we will hear the voice proclaiming that we are sons of God.
