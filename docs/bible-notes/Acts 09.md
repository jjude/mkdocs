- God says to Ananias, that Paul should suffer many things for God's kingdom. Most of us wouldn't even entertain the thought of taking up something if someone says there will be suffering. But that is the cost of following Jesus.
- You can't pray to be Paul and not do what he did. He was at the peak of his popularity. He was growing up in the ladder. But he took up his cross and followed Jesus. He left all of his privileges, prosperity, and people and counted himself as one with the people whom he persecuted.
