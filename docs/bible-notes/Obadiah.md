title: "Notes on Obadiah"
---

- [[Bible Notes]] / [[Obadiah 1]]
- Shortest old testament book
- Talks of Edom gloating over misery of Jacob
- We, Christians, should not gloat over injustice done to our fellow brothers- Muslims, Sikhs etc
- Rather we should stand with them and fight alongside them (fight or only support their fight?)
- 1 Kings‬ 18‬:3‬ - “and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, his palace administrator. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the Lord.” - [[1 Kings-18#v3]]
- As like Daniel & Joseph, Obadiah was in the palace when there was evil around. 
- He risked his life to save God’s prophets
