- [[Mathew]] / [[Mathew 02]]

- Genealogy of Jesus says of five women
	- Tamar - a Canaanite who tricked Judah
	- Rahab was a cannanite prostitute
	- Ruth was a Moabite 
	- Bathsheba was Uriah’s wife
	- And then finally Mary
- Bible doesn’t have super heroes. Ones who don’t have any flaws. Rather God brings his purpose on this earth through the flawed men and women like us. Keep that in mind while feeling guilty about yourself or accusing others. 
- Through the generations Bible has been inclusive. Inclusive of women, inclusive of the lost and the least. We might be privileged today. But in our daily lives let us reach out to the least and the lost. 
- The Bible doesn’t hide flaws of its heroes. It brings them out in public. It doesn’t justify them. It doesn’t throw them condemed. As Paul says it is not a licence to sin but a gracious invitation to be transformed for God’s purpose.
