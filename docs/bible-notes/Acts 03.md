title: "Notes on Acts 03"
---

- [[Acts]]
- Apostles would not have looked like someone having money. What made the lame man to look at them for alms?
- Peter experienced God's forgiveness. So he preaches forgiveness to others
- Refer Parable of the unforgiving servant in [[Mathew 18]]
- Peter says he is giving what he has. Alms # what is extra. Give what you have.
- We usually look for money / wealth, not healing
- Miracles happen when we don't expect
