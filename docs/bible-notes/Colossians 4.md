	- Paul requests Colossians to pray that God will create many chances for him to share the mystery of Christ. And when those chances come he will be able to explain as clearly as possible. Since it is a mystery it is possible to muddle the message and confuse the listener. So we need God’s guidance in explaining the mystery. 
	- All our conversation should be gracious & seasoned with salt. As MSG translation says, the goal is to bring the best in others, not putting them down. I see this balance here - being a dove and a serpent; or love & grace.
	- Purpose of being gracious is to know how to answer the questions abt our faith.
