- [[Bible Notes]]
- Egypt is blessing which becomes a curse in Deuteronomy
- There are no single hero. It is all about family or group
- starts with rivalry between brothers and families - Abel & Cain; Abraham & Lot; Jacob & Esau; Joseph & family. But Joseph changes that. Judah too. He stands in for his brother Benjamin. He is not saying, you took the cup from Pharaoh. No, he commits himself to be in jail.
- Even [[Jonah]] is a “stand in” to sailors. Biblical life is sacrificial, taking up the cross and walking our path.
