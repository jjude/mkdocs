title: "Mark 1"
---
- [[Mark]] / [[Mark 2]]
- All old testament prophecies fulfill in Jesus
- People went out to meet John; Jesus went to meet people. He mingles with people; see how it is different in [[Go into the city]]
- John was confident to say, I'm not the one; it comes from self-confidence, in knowing one's calling
- Spirit sends Jesus to the wilderness; Jonah had the storm because he ran away from God; Paul had storm because he ran for God; [[Handling storms]]
- Baptism, Anointing, and temptation before ministry - even for Jesus; much like in [[Psalm 23]] = after walking through the valley of darkness comes "my cup runs over"
- When you have gone through those three, then you have the power of the Holy Spirit and when you call, people follow you much like John & James
