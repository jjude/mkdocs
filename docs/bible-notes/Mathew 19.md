- Jesus says it is hard for rich men to get into heaven. What he means here is that if you are attached to your riches you can't get into heaven. Because in v21, when Jesus says go and sell, the rich man went away disappointed. As we read about Cornelius in [[Acts 10]], he was a rich man but gave generously. God sent an angel to [[Peter]] to bring salvation to the entire gentiles because of Cornelius.
