---

- [[Bible Notes]]
- [[Galatians 03]]
- No niceties. Getting into topic directly
- Believe & obey will lead to salvation (others) # believe and saved and result in obedience (Paul)
- Two different paradigms & leads to different characteristics
- Abraham got the promise not by law
- Bible is not about gaining information. It is about doing.
- General knowledge is by information. Specific knowledge by doing
- God walks through the split sacrifices when promised to Abraham. His didnâ€™t require Abraham to walk through that. God puts himself to the promise no matter what you do. You have to only believe
