title: "Notes on Ecclesiastes"
---

- [[Bible Notes]] / [[Ecclesiastes 10]]
- Fear of the Lord → Purposeful life → Blessings → Prosperity 
- Not a over-the-counter exchange of short term thinking; but it’s a long term thinking, in fact a life long quest
- Vain doesn’t indicate life is meaningless. The original phrase is, chasing after wind. That doesn’t mean wind isn’t there. Chasing meaning looks like chasing wind, a never ending pursuit
- Two pursuits of meaning in life - autonomous and secular or godly pursuit
	- Autonomous pursuit leads to lady folly = stupidity, destruction (7:29)
	- Godly pursuit leads to purposeful life (12:7)
- Answer to the perplexities of life is to find way back to God and start from there
- trying to understand life only from our experience, reasoning, and observation is folly. Only when we start from the creator, it becomes meaningful 
- The teacher pursues pleasure, music, building projects, wealth, work…and finally concludes all of them are vain. When you start from God you might still do all of them but with a clear sense of purpose rather than for it’s own sake
