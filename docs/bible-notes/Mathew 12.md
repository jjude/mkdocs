- Jesus keeps redefining the norms and the definitions; be it fasting, healing on Sabbath, divorce, selling in temple. You have to ask are you blindly following what everyone is doing or thinking deeply about what you have to do and why you do and shifting things. (ref [[Romans 12]])
- Jesus withdrew when he heard Pharisees are plotting to kill him(v14). But he never withdrew from doing good things.
