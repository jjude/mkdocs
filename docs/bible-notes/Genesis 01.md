title: "Genesis 01"
---
- [[Genesis]]
- God is both panoramic and personal. He creates the universe but also sits down with humans.
- God didn’t intended anyone else to create another universe. So he didn’t go into the details of “how” part of the universe. What matters is not how it was created but what are you doing with what has been handed over to you
- How many of us have read Numbers and Leviticus, two books which contain detailed descriptions of the tribes and their responsibilities? These details are interesting to only select set of people. Not to all.
- Those who complain about the missing details about creation in the Bible are like the children that Jesus talked about in [[Mathew 11]]
