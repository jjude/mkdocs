Chapter 2 is about three things
## Magi’s Visit
- Some wise men from the east came to worship Jesus. From a latter verse we find out that they didn’t come when Jesus was born but at about two years after he was born.
- A star led them until Israel. But why did they go to Herod? Is it because they assumed the king should be born in a palace? We see that even the wise men are shaped by the cultural norms.
- What was the reaction of those who heard the news?
	- Herod is disturbed. Like every tyrant. He calls the scribes and the priests to figure out the place. I find it interesting that the scribes and priests knew the scriptures so well to know where the messiah would be born but they couldn’t figure out who the messiah was.
	- You could read the Bible and know the scriptures so well, but still not know the Lord.
- As soon as the Magi were out of the palace, the place of their norm, they again see the star which leads to the messiah. When you get out of the preconceived ideas, you can take the path that leads to your saviour.

## Joseph’s flight to Egypt
- Our Lord is not a magician. He didn’t snap a finger to protect his own son from his enemies. Rather he directs Joseph to flee.
- When we face our enemies, sometimes fleeing is the right thing to do. We might judge Joseph as a coward for fleeing, if we didn’t know about this angelic visit. So better we don’t make any judgement about someone’s actions. Who knows they were warned by an angel of God?
- You too, don’t be puffed up to stand tall when it is expedient to flee.
- Joseph didn’t want Mary since she conceived a son before marriage. Now he has Mary and even has to run for his own life. But he obeys and takes care of the boy. 
- As a father, I am surprised (and even offended), that there is no mention of Joseph afterwards. Jesus doesn’t mention him later. Even when James, our Lord’s brother, writes a letter he doesn’t reminiscence their days with their father. 

## Herod killing babies
- Like any authoritarian ruler, Herod orders killing of indefensible citizens, in this case infants. This has been history all through whether in Zimbabwe or Sri Lanka or Syria.
- They would like to stick to power by elimination rather than governing well and securing the trust of their citizens.
