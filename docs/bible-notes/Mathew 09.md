- Pharisees question Jesus, why disciples don't fast. Jesus changes the dimension of the topic. He isn't answering them directly. Even disciples might wonder why they aren't required to fast. Jesus says when the bridegroom is around there is only joy. Like what Paul says, we should renew our mind to look at issues from God's perspective. (ref [[Romans 12]])
- A synagogue leader requests Jesus to come to his house and heal his daughter. In between a women comes on the way and gets her healing. While Jesus was healing the women, the leader hears a news that his daughter died. It is possible that he thought if only the woman didn't interrupt, Jesus could've reached my house on time and healed my daughter. Eventually he gets his daughter back. Jesus is not a zero-sum God. He has enough blessing to give to everyone
- Jesus answers the blind, let it be done according to your faith. Same goes for us too. It will be done to us as per our faith.
- When Jesus heals the blind, people rejoice. But Pharisees say this is by the prince of demons. They were not able to accept Jesus as who he was. So they demonize him. Same happens today too. I have seen Carman and John Jebaraj demonized.
